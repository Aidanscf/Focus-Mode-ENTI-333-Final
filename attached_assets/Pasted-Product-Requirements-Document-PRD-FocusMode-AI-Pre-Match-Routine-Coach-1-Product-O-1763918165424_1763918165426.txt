FocusMode — AI Pre-Match Routine Coach 

 

1. Product Overview 

Product Name: FocusMode 
 Platform: Web App (Replit) 
 Owner: Student Product & Engineering Team 

Vision 

Enable athletes to enter their optimal mental and physical readiness state before a match by using AI to deliver a personalized, psychology-based pre-match routine. 

Description 

FocusMode is an AI-powered assistant that generates a personalized 10-minute pre-match routine using an athlete’s profile and match-day text inputs. The system combines mental activation, strategy cues, and basic physiological recommendations into a guided pre-match meditation delivered as both text and audio (via TTS). 

Important MVP Update 

All match-day inputs are text-based only. 

The athlete fills out a structured Strategy Template instead of uploading audio. 

Whisper (audio transcription) is removed from MVP and becomes a Phase 2 upgrade. 

 

2. Goals & Non-Goals 

2.1 MVP Goals 

Provide athletes with a personalized mental activation routine before competition.

Use GPT-4 to generate a guided routine including: 

Breathing & visualization 

Personalized mantra 

Tactical reminders 

Hydration & carb suggestions 

Motivational closing 

Generate audio meditation using TTS. 

Store athlete profile and previous routines in Replit DB. 

2.2 Non-Goals 

No audio uploads or transcription (Whisper is excluded from MVP). 

No wearable or biometric integration. 

No multi-coach/team dashboard (future consideration). 

No native mobile app.

9. Risks & Open Questions 

Risks 

Users may provide low-quality or vague strategy input → routine less effective. 

TTS voice quality varies (ElevenLabs recommended). 

GPT-4 cost considerations for frequent use. 

Open Questions 

Should the strategy template be customizable in future versions? 

Should there be pre-made strategy examples by sport? 

 

10. Success Metrics

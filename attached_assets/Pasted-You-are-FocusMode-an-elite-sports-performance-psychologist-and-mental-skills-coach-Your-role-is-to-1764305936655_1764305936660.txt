 PHYSIOLOGICAL CALCULATIONS (EVIDENCE-BASED) 

Use ACSM, IOC, ISSN-backed formulas. 
 Incorporate athlete gender, weight, hydration habits, sweat tendency, and level of play. 

1. DAILY HYDRATION BASELINE 

Male: weight × 35–45 ml 

Female: weight × 30–40 ml 
 (default midpoint unless heavy sweater) 

→ Daily hydration baseline: {{daily_hydration}} ml 

 

2. HYDRATION 2–4 HOURS BEFORE MATCH 

ACSM guideline: 

5–7 ml/kg 

Heavy sweaters: +3–5 ml/kg 

→ {{hydration_2_4h}} ml 

 

3. HYDRATION 30–60 MINUTES BEFORE MATCH 

ACSM guideline: 

3–5 ml/kg 

→ {{hydration_30_60}} ml 

 

4. MATCH CARBOHYDRATE TARGET 

Based on match duration + level of play: 

If match < 90 minutes: 

Beginner/Intermediate: 0.5–1 g/kg 

Advanced/Elite: 1–1.5 g/kg 

If match ≥ 90 minutes: 

Beginner/Intermediate: 1–1.5 g/kg 

Advanced/Elite: 1.5–2 g/kg 

→ Match carb target: {{carb_intake}} g 

 

5. CARB TIMING 

2–4 hours before match: 

1–3 g/kg 
 → {{carbs_2_4h}} g 

30–60 minutes before match: 

0.5–1 g/kg 
 → {{carbs_30_60}} g 

 

 OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL) 

Your output MUST contain the following sections in this exact order: 

 

1. BREATHING ROUTINE 

(1–2 paragraphs) 

Slow, steady breathing cues 

Simple timing guidance (e.g., inhale 4, exhale 6)

(bullet points, short, clear, actionable) 

 

5. HYDRATION & ENERGY CUE 

(2–3 lines using the updated calculations) 

 

6. MOTIVATIONAL CLOSING 

(1 short paragraph; calm, grounded, confident; no clichés) 

 

 7. 10-MINUTE GUIDED MEDITATION SCRIPT

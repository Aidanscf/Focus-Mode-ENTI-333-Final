This is a **DNS resolution error** - your code is trying to connect to a hostname called "helium" that doesn't exist or can't be found. This typically happens with database connections in authentication setups.

Here are specific solutions you can feed to Replit:

## **Solution 1: Check Database Connection String**
```
The error "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND helium" means the database hostname is invalid. Check your database connection string in .env or config files. Look for:
- DATABASE_URL
- MONGODB_URI
- Any connection string with "helium" in it

The hostname might be wrong. Replace it with the correct database host (like localhost, or the actual database service URL from your provider).
```

## **Solution 2: Use Localhost for Local Database**
```
If you're using a local database in Replit, change the database host to:
- "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" instead of "helium"
- Make sure your database service is running in Replit

Example: mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb
```

## **Solution 3: Fix Environment Variables**
```
The hostname "helium" might be from a placeholder or wrong environment variable. Check:
1. Open .env file
2. Look for any variable containing "helium"
3. Replace with actual database URL from your database provider (MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL, etc.)
4. Restart the application after changing .env
```

## **Solution 4: Use Replit Database**
```
Instead of external database, use Replit's built-in database:
1. Import Replit database: const Database = require("@replit/database")
2. Initialize: const db = new Database()
3. Remove any connection strings referencing "helium"
```

## **Solution 5: Complete Connection String Fix**
```
Find where you initialize your database connection and replace the entire connection string. It should look like:

For MongoDB Atlas: 
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/dbname

For PostgreSQL:
postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database

NOT: something-something://helium:port/database
```

**Ask Replit to:** "Search all files for the word 'helium' and show me where it appears, then replace it with the correct database host URL."
